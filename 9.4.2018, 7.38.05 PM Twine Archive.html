It is a dark and stormy night.  The rain is drenching you and your horse $HorseName as you slowly trot down the path, looking left and right you see no lights or shelter only rolling hills.  You come around a bend and, as luck would have it, the lightening flashes, and you notice, what looks like a cave. 

[[You decide to go in]], or [[keep going]]

The noise of the storm slow receeds and you walk in and turn the corner.  There is a faint smell of animal.  Clearly something has been sleeping here before you.

A quick scan show you that it is currently empty.  [[this will do]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="You push it forward" tags="" position="1019,487" size="100,100">You push it forward but it refuses to move.

Your mind gets thinking about all of the [[bad things]] that could be out here.

You snap back to the presnet as you hourse starts to move backwards... one step... two.. three, four.  It starts to turn and you [[push it harder to go forward]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="push it harder to go forward" tags="" position="1027,800" size="100,100">On instict you tighten your legs and steddly your hourse.

Normally your efforts would be meet with minimal resistance and your hourse would do what you wnated... within reason, however on this occasion your hourse ignores you and slowly moves backwards.

It&#39;s time to make a decision do you [[still keep going]] or do you to try to [[find an alternative]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="bad things" tags="" position="1432,734" size="100,100">Your thoughts race to cougars, bears, packs of wolves or coyotesand...snakes...

That cave that you saw before seems better all of the time.

You cut your losses, flick the reings on the hourse to turn around and go back.

Even you are feeling a little nervious as you ride back along the path.  What were you thinking? what was the plan, just to ride out the rain.  Madness!  Now that you are all wet and scared.  Yes you admit that you are scared.

Your back at the cave entrace [[You decide to go in]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="this will do" tags="" position="514,765" size="100,100">You take a deep breath and walk back to your hourse that you stupidly left alone and tied up.

Stupid, stupid, stupid.

Clearly you are tired and need a break.

You grab the reights (roughter that you normally would) and walk the hourse [[into the cave]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="into the cave" tags="" position="524,980" size="100,100">After walking in you take off your outer clothes.

The fire throws interesting shapes off the walls of the cave as you walk towards the back wall.  The flame from the torch blows size ways as you get close to the back.  As you lower the torch to the back wall the flame changes direction.  You look around a see a crack that runs from the roof to the floor.  It looks to be about body size.

You pull out your rations and nibble on soime biscuits.  All of a sudden you see something reflecting the light of the fire back at you from the other side of the cave.

Crystals in the rock you think.

Do you [[investigate the shinny thing]] or [[Ignore it|Let&#39;s go cowboy]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="start a fire" tags="" position="518,1213" size="100,100">Deciding to start and fire to warm up and most importantly to dry off your clothes.

You gather some small stick from within the cave.  As you search, you feel a breeze near the back of the cave, but the priority is to get warm, so you keep gathering sticks.

There is soon a medium sized fire going in the cave.  You dash outside for some larger wood.

After positioning your clothes on some sticks to dry out you are able to attend to your hourse by taking off the saddle and brushing him down.

Your hourse really appreciates the attention and swings his body over to you to keep warm.  Finally relaxing and enjoy the cave, as you throw on more wood to get thinking back to the [[breeze at the back of the cave]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="want to keep the light down" tags="" position="781,1035" size="100,100">Thinkings it&#39;s too much to start a far you sit there in the cold.

It&#39;s unsafe to to get a fire going you tell yourself.  You never know what or whom could see the light from the flames

You rest out the wet night in your wet clothes and bedding in the dry cave.

You have a very bad nights sleep and start sneezing during the night.

[[NO fire for me]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="investigate the shinny thing" tags="" position="983,1634" size="100,100">OK.  Admitting to yourself that you had better investaigte now before you are thinking about it all night, you get up from your spot.

You need light, so lighting a stick to use as a fire brand you move to where the light was coming from.

Where was it you think as you stumble to the approximate spot.

Flicking the firey brand back and forwards you dissapointly see nothing.

About to give you, you kick something on the ground.  It does not shound or feel like dirty.  Banding down your notice it is something metal.

Digging some more you see it is a pistol.  Old with a wodden handle.  You cannot see much in this light.  You quickly search around for anything else beore you [[move back to the fire]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="move back to the fire" tags="" position="983,1783" size="100,100">With your new pistol in your hand you shuffle back to the fireplace.  Throwing the fire brand into the fire you flop back to the warm spot you and have a better look at what you have got.

It&#39;s a pistol all right.  It&#39;s covered in mud and will need to be cleaned.

Do you want to [[clean it now]] or [[shove it in your bag]] and deal with it tomorrow</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="clean it now" tags="" position="978,1928" size="100,100">Nothing else to do tonight you think to your self, as you get up and move to your saddle bags.

You reach in to the saddle bag and pull out a cleaning cloth and some small tools to scrape off the dirt and muck.

You lay out the tools and get to work.  The fire warms your hands as you restore and clean the pistol.  It&#39;s simple work and keeps your mind off the storm and the cold.

After scraping the polishing the dirt off, you apply a oily rag to the gun and it finally starts to look good.

It&#39;s a magnificent piee of equipment with a wodden handle and a long slender barrel.  A rose on each side of the barrel adorns the gun.  The wodden handle shines and relects the fire.  This will fetch alot at the next town.

Do you want to [[place it into the saddle bag]] or [[replace your current gun]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="shove it in your bag" tags="" position="1350,2074" size="100,100">After all of the bad luck that you have had with the storm and everything you just want to call an end to the day.

You put the pistol into your saddle bad and go back to the fire.

[[Time to call it a night]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="place it into the saddle bag" tags="" position="960,2183" size="100,100">You look at the gun, immedataly thinking that there is no way it is going to work when you shoot it.

There is only one way to find out if it is going to work.

Do you want to [[give it a try]] or just [[leave it alone|shove it in your bag]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="replace your current gun" tags="" position="810,2178" size="100,100">(set: $Weapon to &quot;Pistol&quot;)

You look at the pistol and then look at your gun in it&#39;s holster.

Your gun looks old and tired.  This gun looks like the real deal.

Casully you slip the old gun out and the new gun in.  It fits sungly and feels right.

You walk back to the fire

Is it time to [[move on|Let&#39;s go cowboy]] or [[Give the new gun a try|give it a try]]


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="explore the hole" tags="" position="206,2791" size="100,100">Slowly you manuver your body thru the crack

It&#39;s a tight fit but you manage to get thru with only a frew scrapes.

From the looks of it, this cave opens up into a secondary cave.

It smells a bit funny here... like something has died you think.

*too slow* You turn around a corner and find yourself standing just in front of a bear.

The bear looks at your and starts to get up from it&#39;s spot.

Now is the time to do something.  Do you [[reach for your gun]] or [[start running]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Let&#39;s go cowboy" tags="" position="423,2111" size="100,100">The rain keeps pouring down outside.  If anything it seems to be getting stronger some how.

Looks ike you will be here for a while you think.

You get up and check your horse again.  He seems to have calmed down and is warming up near the fire.

You adjust your clothes so they dry out the damp spots.

[[Time to call it a night]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="give it a try" tags="" position="1050,2333" size="100,100">You load up the camber with bullets and walk to the mouth of the cave.  Realising you are still close to your housrse you move right to the edge of the cave.  The rain is still pelting down.

you casually bring the gun up and aim it at a nearby tree.

[[Here goes nothing you think]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="reach for your gun" tags="" position="120,2998" size="100,100">**Too Slow**

You are *way* to slow... you think as you reach for your gun... with the bear charging you mouth wide

[[ohh well]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="start running" tags="" position="258,2998" size="100,100">It&#39;s now or never you think as you turn to run.  You can see that the bear is going to chase you.

Your starting to get up some pace when you hear the bear starting to run as well.  You can feel the thump of his feet and it&#39;s panting.

Your nearing the the crack when you realise that you will not be able to take your time and slowly squeeze thru.

[[Dive thru the crack]] or [[Try to out smart the bear]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Here goes nothing you think" tags="" position="976,2483" size="100,100">&#39;&#39;Bam&#39;&#39;

It first a perfectly straight shot and practically destroys the tree.  Gee this thing packs a punch.

Feeling satisfied you pull out your old gun and replace it with the new one.

You walk back to the fire

You seem to have caught a really bad cold or flu or something over night.

It&#39;s bad and you can hardly get up and out of bed.  Seems that $HorseName has the same problem as he just seems to by lying down.

You try to make some food but give up half way as you loose you appetite

After a few hours you start coughing and sneezing...

This is NOT going away...

after a few more hours it&#39;s night time and you are on totally cold and shivering from the cold even thought you have every blanket and clothes on you.

You decide to take the time to make yourself a big breakfast to feul up your body after all of the activity yesterday/last night.

After the breakfast and clean up, you pack up $HorseName with all of your bedding and cooking stuff and slowly manouver her out of the cave entrance.

Alot of braches and trees have been knocked down and the ground is very soft from all of the water over night.  This just makes you very thankfull for the shelter of the cave.

You keep going along the path, in the same direction as what you did yesterday.  After a short while you come to a fork in the road.

You pat $HorseName neck as you think about what next.  The left goes up a hill and looks like open ground, while right goes down a hill into the trees.

Do you [[go left up the hill]] or [[go right into the trees]]?

	You see an asteriod comming in from your ships top right.  It&#39;s comming in fast.  In your minds eye you realise that your not going to be able avoid it.  You dont have time to check your sheilds for status.  This is all going to cost you alot of credits in repair bills, if you survive!

So, the ship takes over the navigation.  You clench your teeth knowing that this going to be brutal and that this is going to cost you in the repair bill and fuel.  When the ship is in navigation mode it is programmed, to do whatever it needs to do and use as much thrust as it needs to avoid a collision!
You flick an eye to your seat belts as the first lurch hits.  and it hits hard.  The ship takes a massive drop and roll to the right.  You are pinned to the front of the seat belt and your eyes feel like they are going to pop out of there sockets.  Luckily it only lasts a few seconds before the savageness of the move abates.  You notice that the warning alarm is going.
When did that start, you think?
The enviro settings, tell you that the move made the ship hit 7G&#39;s.  That will give you marks on your shoulders.  You reach out to activate the seat controls to soften the impact but another lurch hits... this one is at 9g&#39;s, and prevents you from reaching the control as the ship goes into a backwards burn.  You try again and make contact this time.

A hissing sound tells you that it is active.  Not much to do now but [[enjoy the ride]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="new thing" tags="" position="1368,1615" size="100,100">akdshyfa</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
